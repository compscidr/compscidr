### Jason Ernst
I'm currently Principal Software Engineer at a startup working on mobile ad hoc networks.

Prior to this, I worked at two difference robotics startups (Rapid Robotics and Osaro) in San Francisco. I've previously worked on wireless mesh networks, and wrote a [library](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1HQc9Sqe59hFi9VfWAT68su4nLdH2DOj) that let's you connect Android phones using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi direct. This project had an ICO which raised $30M. I also started a 
[robotics company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L40ilSO6tZU&list=PL1HQc9Sqe59hfpogQN5kNTqNuThDw2oZ_) during grad school. I did a PhD and MSc in computer science
focused mostly on [wireless mesh networks](https://jasonernst.com/research). I was awarded a $2.1M grant to support graduate students studying mesh networks as part of this project. I once won Canada's
largest hackathon at the time in [2014 called CODE](https://betakit.com/ontario-university-students-win-federal-governments-code-appathon/). I built an app using open data from the government of Canada to help new immigrants select a city in Canada to 
live in.

I've been learning a bit of [Go](https://github.com/compscidr/goblog) and Kotlin, and am interested in Rust. I've done a bunch of work in 
[Java](https://github.com/compscidr/awm-lib), C/C++, Python, [PHP](https://github.com/compscidr/awm-lib-server), Javascript, and HTML. I'm really interested in network protocols, [operating systems](https://github.com/compscidr/pos), multi-process and multi-threaded 
systems. I like visualizing sytems and the data that comes from them. I really like codebases that have CI/CD, testing, and coverage tools setup. 
I like [infrastructure as code](https://github.com/compscidr/iac). I like exploring architectures, patterns and frameworks. I also like 
analyzing the performance of systems and network protocols and finding ways to make them faster or scale to larger sizes. I try to do things incrementally and make small bits of progress of code in bursts while I'm interested or have time.

Love collaborating on stuff - feel free to reach out or make PRs into any of my repos.
